@file queryManager.py
This file contains the code to perform vector search on a MongoDB collection using the OpenAI embeddings and the MongoDB Atlas Vector Search.
The code uses the langchain_openai, langchain_mongodb, langchain_core libraries to perform the vector search and retrieve the most relevant documents.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to generate the embeddings using the generateVectorDB.py script before and be sure to intialize the MongoDB Atlas Vector Search index before running this script.

STEPS THAT OCCUR IN THE BACKGROUND when .invoke() is called on the rag_chain instance 
Please email me skverma@ncsu.edu if you have any further questions

Step 1 INVOCATION: Invocation of rag chain with the question. Method call triggers the chains operation starting with the retriever

Step 2 RETRIEVER FUNC: The retriever retrieves the most relevant documents from the MongoDB collection based on the question. Converts question into embedding and 
uses this to perform a similarity search in the database, retrieving documents that are contextually similar to the query.

Step 3 DOC FORMATTING: The retrieved documents are passed to the next step in the chain, which is the format_docs function. This function formats the documents 
into a single string with each document separated by double newlines (basically processing output from retriever)

Step 4 CONTEXT ASSEMBLY: The formatted documents and the question are passed to the custom_rag_prompt function to from complete context. RunnablePassthrough 
is highly important here to make sure no mods occur to question. 

Step 5 PROMPT TEMPLATE: template recieves step 4 and fills it out where context is replaced by the output from format_docs and question is replaced by the output from RunnablePasst

Step 6 LANGUAGE MODEL: templated string are passed to the language model, which generates a response based on the input.model generates a response based on the input prompt, 
considering the provided context and directly addressing the query.

Step 7 POST PARSE: Takes output and converts it into a string. If it is already a string, return it otherwise if it is a structured object, convert it to a string.
